1. Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The client, The Gaming Room, required a cross-platform web-based game named "Draw It or Lose It." The game needed to support multiple teams competing to guess drawings within predefined rounds. Essential requirements included team management, unique names, and a singleton instance for resource optimization.

2. What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

In developing the documentation, I effectively summarized the client's requirements, outlined design constraints, and provided detailed recommendations for the software architecture. I also evaluated different development platforms and the rationale behind choosing Linux for its scalability and cost-efficiency.  

3. What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

Working through the design document helped me understand the project's scope, identify potential challenges, and make informed decisions about the architecture and technologies to use. It provided a roadmap for the development process, ensuring that the final product meets the client's needs and requirements.
  
4. If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
If I could revise one part of my work, I would improve the articulation of the evaluation section by providing more specific examples of how each development platform aligns with the project requirements. This would enhance the clarity and depth of the evaluation.
5. How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
Interpreting the user's needs involved careful consideration of the game's objectives, target audience, and technical requirements. By understanding the client's goals and preferences, I was able to design a software solution that meets their expectations and provides an enjoyable gaming experience. Considering the user's needs is crucial in developing software because it ensures the final product is user-friendly, intuitive, and meets the intended purpose. By prioritizing user needs, we can create a product that resonates with the target audience and drives user satisfaction and engagement.
   
6. How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
In approaching software design, I employed requirements analysis, system modeling, and evaluation of different design options. In the future, I would continue to use these techniques while also incorporating user feedback and iterative development to refine the software application further. Additionally, leveraging design patterns and best practices would help ensure the software solution's scalability, maintainability, and performance.
